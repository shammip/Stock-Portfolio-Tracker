Day/Time/TimeZone for the scheduled team weekly meeting (30 minutes via Zoom): Monday 5pm MT 

Vision statement: 
* Our Portfolio Tracking product provides a clean and simple interface for monitoring stocks of interest. Customers can search for a stock that they are interested in, add/remove stocks from their dashboard, or click on a stock for more information. All stock price and related company analytics are retrieved frequently and safely from reliable sources. 

Motivation: 
* Numerous stock trackers exist today, but many are not user friendly, and are overburdened with technical features that most users do not need. The motivation for this project is to offer a lightweight solution for users to track a portfolio, or for users to simulate different financial scenarios quickly and easily.
* Another motivation is the breadth of analysis options that a large market dataset presents. There are many ways we can summarize, visualize, and present data to the user, so it will be interesting to develop different use cases as we dig into the data. 

Risks to project completion, possibly including:
* One main risk that we will encounter is team members not being familiar with or proficient with the technologies. The technologies may include but are not limited to: JupyterHub, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, libraries (Bootstrap, Beautiful Soup), Git/GitHub, SQL and working with data.
* Another risk includes team members’ availability to attend weekly meetings, which may affect the distribution of the workload.
* We will need to be mindful of time management. It is imperative to complete our assigned tasks by the allocated date to ensure sufficient time for team members to review the work and provide feedback.
* In terms of risks with the version control system Git, we may run into issues involving branches, committing, and merging.  

Mitigation Strategy for Above Risks:
* Team Members Lack of Proficiency with Technologies 
    * Allocate time for tutorials and documentation reviews. 
    * Any team member with experience of an otherwise new technology should be accessible for questions from other team members.
* Team Members’ Availability for Weekly Meetings 
    * Determine a weekly recurring time that works for most members and adjust the time if needed. 
    * If a team member cannot make a meeting, tools such as Trello and Outlook can be used record project status. 
* Time Management 
    * Breaking down tasks into manageable user stories, taking into account all team members’ schedules. 
    * Frequent communication allows for development blocks to be handled efficiently. 
    * Establish clearly defined deliverables prevents scope creep. 
* Version Control
    * Maintain a main branch via Git and work on specific features in dedicated branches. 
    * Another team member should review a developer’s changes before any branch is merged with the main branch. 

Development method: 
* We will use scrum for our development method. We will break the work for building our project into story cards and organize those cards to be completed in 1-week sprints. We will have a standup at the beginning of each sprint to monitor our progress and make sure not blocked. We will also hold retrospective meetings to make sure our team members are happy and productive by discussing what is going well, what isn’t going well, and what needs to be changed.
* We chose scrum because it allows us to adjust to changes most easily in an agile environment. The details for this project are not clearly defined in the beginning so we will need to be constantly making decisions about what to work on and when. We may even need to make major pivots in the project’s functionality. Scrum works very well for this type of development.
* Scott is currently the scrum master, but there are other members on the team who have interest in getting experience in this role, so we may rotate that position throughout the project to give others the opportunity to experience it as well as add their own ideas into how the scrum master role is implemented.
